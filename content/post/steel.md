  access plant earlier

In a village hall near the steel works, the prime minister shakes the hands of workers who have gathered.

It’s a buoyant mood here. There’s excitement and relief at what their future now looks like.

Keir Starmer’s message to them is clear. Control. It’s control over the site and decisions that are made beyond the entrance gates, and that means the blast furnaces will stay on, he says.

“A future for steel matters to you, your families, the next generation,” he tells them.

“I hope there’s some relief,” he adds.

Some of the people here are steel workers, but also there are representatives from trade unions.

One member thanks him and added “the unions are united as one”.
