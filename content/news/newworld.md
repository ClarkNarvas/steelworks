**Labour unveils landmark plans to unlock thousands of apprenticeships across the country**

> \*\* Education Secretary bolsters Government plans to go “further, faster” on growth
> Marie Tidball MP, Member of Parliament for Penistone and Stocksbridge, has welcomed Labour’s reform of the skills system to unlock opportunity and drive growth across Penistone and Stocksbridge.\*\*

Labour has unveiled new measures to slash the red tape which has prevented businesses from taking on more apprentices. Employers will have more flexibility through the removal of 12-month requirements to support shorter duration apprenticeships in key sectors.
In a landmark reform, Labour will be bringing apprenticeships in line with the wider educational system by removing the requirement for GCSE English and Maths for adults over the age of 19 who wish to complete an apprenticeship. This will break down the barriers to opportunity and unlock apprenticeships for up to 10,000 more young people across the country with the support of businesses.

Moreover, Labour is modernising the apprenticeship experience by creating more courses alighted to the government’s missions and the industries of the future. This includes the creation of a new app that serves as a ‘one-stop shop’ to simplify apprentices’ journey with tools, resources, and support available at the touch of a finger.
These announcements follow the first set of apprenticeship statistics under the new Labour government, which show an increase in starts, participation and achievements compared to the same period in 2023. Across Sheffield and Barnsley, there are 7,870 apprentices currently on their course, with 450 having recently completed their course, and 1,730 beginning their apprenticeship between August and October 2024.

Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson MP, said:

“Apprenticeships will power this mission-driven government and our Plan for Change.
“The steps we are taking show we are serious about going further and faster in our pursuit of growth, so we can put money in working people’s pockets and raise living standards.
“Labour will harness the talents of young people through ambitious apprenticeship reform to drive growth and unlock opportunity.”
Marie Tidball MP, Member of Parliament for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said:
“For many young people in our communities, apprenticeships offer a route to good wages, skills, and qualifications in a range of sectors. We have prime opportunities in our constituency to support apprenticeships, such as in the steel or manufacturing industry.
“I’m delighted that the Government have demonstrated their commitment to skills and bolstering the workforce by slashing the red tape to let businesses take on more apprentices and offering more opportunities to mark National Apprenticeship Week.
“These measures will make a huge difference and offer hope to hundreds of young people across Penistone and Stocksbridge by breaking down the barriers to opportunity.\\\
