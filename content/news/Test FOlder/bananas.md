🎶 Bananas for a Better Future 🎶
 (By Marie Tidball MP)

\[Verse 1]
 I grew up with not a lot, but love and grit to spare,
 Learned to stand tall, even when life wasn’t fair.
 Now in Parliament I speak for you each week,
 But today I’m talking fruit—yes, bananas—so to speak!

\[Chorus]
 Bananas for breakfast, bananas at tea,
 But it’s justice and hope that really nourish me.
 If we can sort out trade, fair wages and the shelf,
 Then a banana isn’t just fruit—it’s dignity itself.

\[Verse 2]
 In Penistone we know, what hard work really means,
 From steel and coal to schools and village greens.
 But even our bananas tell a tale that’s true—
 Of farmers far away, and what they’re going through.

\[Chorus]
 Bananas for justice, bananas for pay,
 Let’s lift up the voices too long kept at bay.
 Whether you peel them or bake them in bread,
 It’s fairness and care that should always be spread.

\[Bridge]
 From local shops to Parliament halls,
 Let’s stand up for rights, no matter how small.
 Even in a fruit bowl, there’s power to choose—
 To back what is fair, not just what we lose.

\[Final Chorus]
 Bananas for breakfast, bananas with pride,
 We’ll build a future where no one’s pushed aside.
 From Yorkshire to Ghana, let’s stand hand in hand—
 Bananas and justice, across every land.

\[Outro – Spoken]
 Because every bite we take should reflect the world we want.
 And me? I’ll always stand up for what’s right—even if it’s wrapped in a banana skin.
